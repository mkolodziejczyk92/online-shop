# Online Shop
***
### Introduce
***
This project is fully functioning web application that is an online shop. 
The main part is REST API that allows users:
- buy items
- manage sales
- managing users

### General information
***
**API is secured** - some actions are allowed only for proper user. There are three types of users:
- **user** - buy item
- **admin** - edit item information, change user account status, delete user
- **super-admin** - delete or add admin account

**MySQL** - this database is used. All tables can be generated automatically thanks to Hibernate. 
Now this option is disabled and all tables are generated by FlyWay. When the API is first run, 
the database is populated with initial data and three default users are created.

**API is responsive** - can be used on other electronic devices, not only on a computer.

**Tests** - the project include unit and integration tests. The scope of tests is to verify the operation of the Controllers 
and check that all layers together work correctly.

**Default accounts** - if you want to check all API features select one of the available default users

`````onlineshopdb`````.

**3.** Check *application.properties* if datasource username and password are compatible with yours. 
The default setting is password and username from environment variables.
